#' Full Annotation Using Shape-constrained Trees
#'
#' This function can be used as the first step of a FAUST analysis.
#'
#' @param gatingSet The FAUST method requires that experimental cytometry
#' data you wish to analyze is stored in a `GatingSet` data structure. This data
#' structure can be constructed available using the `flowWorkspace` Bioconductor
#' package.
#'
#' @param startingCellPop A character vector specifying the node from the manual
#' gating strategy attached to the `gatingSet` to use for `faust` analysis. The
#' node in the manual gating strategy is, at minimum, asusmed by `faust` to have
#' pre-gated debris and dead cells. For example, the node might identify live
#' lymphocytes in each sample.
#'
#' @param activeChannels A character vector, each entry of which is a marker name
#' to be used in the `faust` analysis. The markers listed in this parameter must
#' **exactly** match the `desc` field of the `parameters` of the `flowFrames` in
#' the `GatingSet. `FAUST` will not run if they do not match exactly.
#'
#' @param channelBounds This parameter accepts three settings: an empty string,
#' a matrix, and a list.
#'
#' The matrix setting: A 2 by `length(activeChannels)` numeric matrix, with
#' `colnames(channelBounds) <- activeChannels` and
#' `rownames(channelBounds) <- c("Low","High")`. Expression values in a channel
#' less than or equal to the value in the "Low" row are treated as low, by
#' default, and not actively considered when `FAUST` processes the data.
#' Expression values in a channel greater than or equal to the value in the "High"
#' row are treated as high, by default, and not actively considered when `FAUST`
#' processes the data.
#'
#' If the user provides the empty string "", channel bounds will be determined
#' empirically.
#'
#' When the user provides either the empty string "" or a single numeric matrix
#' as the `channelBounds` setting, the same channel bounds matrix will apply to
#' all samples in the experiment. However, if the user is analyzing a dataset
#' whose analysis supports using the `imputationHierarchy` parameter, different
#' levels of the imputation hierarchy can be assigned distinct channelBounds
#' matrices. To do this, pass faust a list of 2 by `length(activeChannels)`
#' matrices. The length of the list must equal the number of distinct levels in
#' the imputation hierarchy. The name of each slot of the list must be a unique
#' level of the imputation hierarchy. FAUST will then analyze all experimental
#' units grouped by that level using the supplied channel bounds matrix.
#'
#' @param experimentalUnit A character vector specifying the experimental unit
#' of analysis of samples contained in the gating set. If left as its default
#' value "", the "name" column in `pData(gatingSet)` will be used as the
#' experimental unit, leading to `FAUST` analyzing each sample independently.
#' If modified by the user, the value must match one of the strings in
#' `colnames(pData(gatingSet))`; the corresponding column of the data frame
#' `pData(gatingSet)` will be used to concatenate individual samples into
#' experimental units for analysis by `FAUST`.
#'
#' @param imputationHierarchy A character vector specifying the imputation
#' hierarchy for annotation boundaries computed by FAUST. If left as its default
#' value "", `FAUST` will impose no hierarchy on the data. If modified by the
#' user, the value must match one of the strings in `colnames(pData(gatingSet))`;
#' the corresponding column of the data frame `pData(gatingSet)` will
#' be used to impose the impose the imputation hierarchy: for each selected
#' marker, experimental units that do not empirical support annotation bondaries
#' for a marker will first attempt to use other experimental units with the same
#' `imputationHierarchy` coding to impute boundaries. If this is not possible,
#' annotation boundaries will be imputed usining boundaries from all experimental
#' units.
#'
#' @param projectPath An absolute path on your system that locates all
#' intermediate data produced by faust. At the location specified by the
#' projectPath, `faust` creates a directory called `faustData`, and
#' subdirectories that contain intermediate data generated by the analysis. The
#' final output of `faust`, an annotated matrix of counts, is produced at
#' `projectPath/faustData/faustCountMatrix.rds`, and can be loaded into R using
#' the `readRDS` function.
#'
#' @param depthScoreThreshold A numeric value between 0 and 1 used for marker
#' selection. `faust` uses this parameter in conjunction with the
#' `selectionQuantile` parameter to determine which markers to use for discovery
#' and annotation. `faust` automatically produces a plot
#' "projectPath/faustData/plotData/scoreLines.pdf" that can be used to help set
#' this threshold value for an experiment.
#'
#' @param selectionQuantile A numeric value between 0 and 1 used for marker
#' selection. Depth scores are computed for all experimental units in the
#' experiment. FAUST computes the empirical selectionQuantile  across each
#' channel: `quantile(channelDepthScores,probs=selectionQuantile)`. The
#' empirical quantile is then compared to the depthScoreThreshold for each
#' marker. All markers with empirical quantile above the depthScoreThreshold
#' are used by `faust` to discover and annotate cell subsets in the experiment.
#'
#'
#' @param supervisedList A list of lists. The names of list entries correspond
#' to marker names in the active channels vector to which supervision is
#' applied. Channels named in this list will have their gate locations modified.
#' 
#' Supported supervision: 'Preference'. Asserts a preference for the number of
#' annotation boundaries for a targeted marker. If this is selected, FAUST will
#' attempt to standardize to the preferred number of boundaries across experimental
#' units if there is empirical data to support the preference.
#'
#' Example syntax:
#' 
#' supervisedList <- list(`Target_Marker` = list(actionType = "Preference", action = c(2)))
#'
#' @param debugFlag Boolean value. Set to TRUE to print method status information
#' to the console or a log file.
#'
#' @param threadNum Integer value. Many components of the FAUST method support
#' multi-threading on a single CPU. Set this parameter to the number of threads
#' you wish to use.
#'
#' @param seedValue Integer value that determines the random seed. Used for
#' reproducibility.
#'
#' @param annotationsApproved Boolean value. FALSE by default to encourage the
#' user to review the proposed annotation boundaries. When set to TRUE, indicates
#' the user wants to use the proposed annotation boundaries to cluster and gate
#' the experiment. If you want to run the FAUST method totally unsupervised,
#' set this parameter to true before running the `faust` function.
#'
#' @param drawAnnotationHistograms Boolean. Set to TRUE to draw the annotation
#' boundary locations for selected markers for all samples and all markers. Set
#' to FALSE to forego the plotting.
#' 
#' @param densitySubSampleThreshold Integer value. 
#' Sets the number of cells needed in a clustering collection to sub-sample for density estimation.
#' NOTE: sub-sampling only occurs for density estimation. The dip test is computed on all cells
#' in the clustering collection. 
#' 
#' @param densitySubSampleSize Integer value.
#' The number of cells to sub-sample from a clustering collection for density estimation.
#' NOTE: sub-sampling only occurs for density estimation. The dip test is computed on all cells
#' in the clustering collection. 
#' 
#' @param densitySubSampleIterations Integer value.
#' The number of distinct sub-sampled density estimates to compute. The final gate location is the median
#' across the sub-sampled densities.
#' NOTE: sub-sampling only occurs for density estimation. The dip test is computed on all cells
#' in the clustering collection. 
#' 
#' @param archDescriptionList list containing slot "targetArch".
#' Default "singleCPU" indicates FAUST will run on a single processor.
#'
#' FAUST also has preliminary support for dispatching jobs across nodes of a
#' cluster managed by slurm. This support assumes the "sbatch" command is
#' available to launch jobs on the cluster.
#'
#' Also note that the current implementation does not dynamically restart jobs
#' that fail to launch after sbatch is invoked. In the event a job fails to launch,
#' the faust call must be interrupted and called again.
#'
#' `faust` attempts to check-point much of the intermediate progress in order to
#' avoid performing redundant computation.
#'
#' Set "targetArch" slot to "slurmCluster" to dispatch jobs across a cluster
#' managed by slurm. When "targetArch" is set to "slurmCluster", the following
#' slots must be set by the user.
#'
#' Slot "partitionID": Character string. The name of the partition on which jobs
#' are run.
#'
#' Slot "jobPrefix": Character string. This string will prepend all jobs launched
#' on the slurm cluster. When "squeue" is used to interrogate job state, this
#' string can be used to identify jobs.
#'
#' Slot "jobTime"" Character string. This string sets the maximum time a job
#' launched by faust on the slurm cluster can run. String format follows
#' 'HH:MM:SS'.
#'
#' Slot "maxNodeNum": Numeric value. The maximum number of nodes you wish to
#' request on the slurm cluster.
#'
#' Slot "maxTime": Numeric value. The total amount of time you want to run FAUST
#' for. When exceeded, the job terminates.
#'
#' Slot "nodeThreadNum": Character string. The number of threads used by FAUST
#' on each node.
#'
#' Slot "sbatchFlags": Character string. This string contains space-delimited
#' command-line flags to pass to sbatch.
#'
#' @param plottingDevice string with device for saving graphical output.
#' By default it is set to "pdf".
#'
#' @return generateAnnotationThresholds is used to generate standardized
#' annotation thresholds prior to the discovery phase of the FAUST analysis.
#' It will initialize a directory called "faustData" located at the projectPath parameter.
#' It will store intermediate and checkpointing data in this directory.
#' When it concludes, a sub-directory called "faustData/plotData" will be created.
#' This directory will contain diagnostic plots to review before proceeding to the discovery
#' and annotate stage of the FAUST method.
